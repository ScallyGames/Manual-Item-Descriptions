    <description>This mod is basically External Item Descriptions but without the predefined item descriptions. Instead it allows you to write down your own notes and speculations what the items do.

I've made this mod because I think a huge draw of BoI is the discovery aspect of the game which EID pretty much removes. However, with the amount of items the game has it gets really difficult to remember everything. To avoid having to note everything down on a notepad and finding your notes as needed, this incorporates it like EID but restricts everything to the information you've gathered yourself.

Note: this mod was created as a separate mod but from a fork of EID with approval of Wofsauge and another contributer.</description>
